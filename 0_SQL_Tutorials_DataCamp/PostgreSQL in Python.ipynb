    "A database is an organized collection of structured data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Despite the recent development of new types of databases (designed to address the increasing volume and variability of data), a considerable amount of data around the world is still stored in what are known as relational databases. Relational databases store data as collections of predefined tables with rows and columns that are connected through one or more relationships. \n",

    "Being able to wrangle and extract data from these databases is an essential skill within the data industry and is a skill in increasing demand. The standard way to create and manage databases is SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is the building block for some of the most popular relational databases on the market, such as PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and SQLite\n",

In essence, the connection encapsulates a database session, and it allows you to execute SQL commands and queries, such as SELECT, INSERT, CREATE, UPDATE, OR DELETE, using the cursor() method, and to make changes persistent using the commit() method. \n",

    "## Using PostgreSQL in DataCamp DataLab\n",
    "\n",
    "At DataCamp, we work hard to make data science easier and accessible to everyone. That was the reason behind the creation of DataCamp DataLab, a cloud-based notebook specifically designed for data science. You can think of DataCamp DataLab as a mix between Jupyter Notebook and Google Docs which allows users to write code, analyze data individually or collectively, and share data insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting DataLab to PostgreSQL databases, as well as other SQL databases, is extremely easy. DataLab allows you to connect to data sources in a secure way, while you can seamlessly continue your data analysis with Python or R. You just need to create an integration, following a straightforward, no-code process, where you will need to enter your connection credentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows how to create a PostgreSQL integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, If you want to try the integration but don't have a PostgreSQL database to connect to, you can just use one of our available sample PostgreSQL databases!\n",
    "\n",
    "Curious about DataCamp DataLab? Check out this article to know more about this next-generation notebook for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice work! In this tutorial, you got acquainted with PostgreSQL and learned how to manage databases without leaving Python, using the psycopg2 package. But this is just the beginning of the journey. SQL is one of the most widely-used programming languages in data science. It’s also fairly easy to learn, so you have no excuse.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Datacamp gets you covered. Here are some resources that might help you to become fluent in PostgreSQL and SQL in general:\n",
