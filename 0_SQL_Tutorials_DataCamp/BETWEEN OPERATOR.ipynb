    "### Important Points to Remember About SQL BETWEEN\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the BETWEEN operator, it is important to note that it is placed in the WHERE clause of the SELECT statement. This placement ensures the BETWEEN operator filters the column highlighted by the WHERE clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Select all columns from the Employees table\\\n",

    "\n",
    "The BETWEEN operator is preferred for filtering values within ranges since it provides concise data filtering. The syntax is simple and improves query readability when filtering multiple conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without the BETWEEN operator, we use other operators to achieve similar results. Note the inclusion of the operators in the WHERE clause, which makes the query less readable and complex.\n",

    "WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 60000;\n",

    "\n",
    "### Filtering numeric ranges with BETWEEN\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also combine the BETWEEN operator with other operators to achieve complex filtering scenarios. This technique is important if you want specific filtering. In the example below, we have used the equal (=) operator in the WHEN clause to filter rows containing only the Sales department. The query then uses the BETWEEN operator to filter the records further, including those salaries between 50,000 and 60,000.\n",

    "Potential Confusion of the Inclusive Boundaries: Since the BETWEEN operator includes the specified values as upper and lower bounds, it could lead to confusion or unexpected results if used incorrectly.\n",
    "Performance Issues with Large Datasets: Using the BETWEEN operator without specifying the indexes could lead to performance issues, especially when using large datasets.\n",
    "### Alternatives to the BETWEEN operator in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the BETWEEN operator includes the specified values as lower and upper bounds, we can use the less than (<) and greater than (>) operators to achieve exclusive filtering. This technique will ensure these values are not included in the results.\n",
