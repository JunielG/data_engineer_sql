    "- Use database profiling tools to monitor query performance and optimize when handling large datasets.\n",
    "- When using REPLACE() to modify the string values, maintain the indexes regularly to ensure they match.\n",
    "- Initiate batch processing to reduce query execution time when handling large datasets.\n",
