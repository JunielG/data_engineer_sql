    "2 Unexpected results with wildcards: Make sure % and _ are used correctly. % matches any number of characters, while _ matches exactly one character. Misplacing these can lead to unexpected matches.\\\n",
    "3 Performance issues: If your query is slow, look for leading % in patterns (e.g., %pattern), which disables index usage. Rewrite patterns to start with a specific string if possible. See the section below for more on performance. \\\n",
    "4 SQL injection errors: If you’re using user input in your query, make sure it is properly parameterized to avoid syntax errors or vulnerabilities.\\\n",
    "5 Special characters in patterns: Wildcard symbols like % and _ in the search string must be escaped if intended as literal characters. Use ESCAPE in your query to define an escape character.\\\n",

    "# Performance Considerations When Using the LIKE Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIKE operator is great, but it can potentially impact query performance, especially when used on large datasets. Here are some considerations to optimize its use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Indexes: The LIKE operator performs best when the pattern starts with a constant string, such as Adam%, because the database can use indexes. However, patterns like %Adam or %Adam% require a full table scan, which can be slow for large tables.\\\n",
    "2 Avoid leading wildcards: Starting a pattern with %, such as %pattern, disables index usage, as the database has to examine every record.\\\n",
    "3 Collation and case-insensitive matching: Using functions like LOWER() or UPPER() on columns for case-insensitive searches can also prevent indexes from being used. Instead, make sure the database collation is set appropriately for case-insensitive comparisons.\\\n",
    "4 Alternative approaches: For large datasets, consider using full-text search or database-specific search features, such as GIN indexes in PostgreSQL or FULLTEXT indexes in MySQL, when performing complex or frequent string matching.\\\n",
    "5 Selective queries: Limit the scope of your queries using additional filters, such as date ranges or numerical columns, to reduce the data processed by the LIKE operator."
