    "The PIVOT operator in SQL Server and Oracle is an extremely useful technique that transforms table rows into columns. Not only does the PIVOT operator improve the readability and interpretation of query results, but it also makes it easier to understand data trends by using aggregations to create pivot tables or cross-tabulations. These pivot tables are particularly helpful in reports that require nice visualizations. \n",
