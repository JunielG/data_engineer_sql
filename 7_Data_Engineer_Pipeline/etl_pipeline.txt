## Key Features
Data Ingestion
- Multiple data source support (APIs, CSV, JSON files)
- Asynchronous data extraction for better performance
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Configurable batch processing

Data Transformation
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Date format normalization
- Record deduplication using hashing
- Data aggregation capabilities
- Metadata enrichment

Data Storage
- SQLite database for reliable storage
- Separate tables for raw and processed data
- Transaction management and error recovery
- Data export to CSV and JSON formats

Pipeline Orchestration
- Configurable pipeline runs
- Batch processing with configurable sizes
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Run metadata tracking

Monitoring & Scheduling
- Pipeline run statistics and monitoring
- Scheduled execution (daily/hourly)
- Comprehensive logging system
- Status reporting and health checks

Architecture Components
- DataSource Classes - Abstract base for different data sources
- DataTransformer - Handles cleaning, validation, and transformations
- DataStorage - Manages database operations and file exports
- DataPipeline - Main orchestrator that coordinates all components
- PipelineScheduler - Handles automated scheduling and monitoring

## Usage Examples
The pipeline includes a demo function that shows how to:
- Set up data sources (API and file-based)
- Configure the pipeline
- Run data processing
- Monitor results and status

## Production Considerations
To adapt this for production use:
- Replace sample data sources with your actual APIs, databases, or file systems
- Configure authentication for your data sources
- Set up proper monitoring and alerting
- Scale the database (consider PostgreSQL or cloud databases)
- Add data quality checks and validation rules
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Set up proper secrets management for API keys and credentials
