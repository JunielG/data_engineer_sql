## Key Features:
🏗️ Modular Architecture
- Separate classes for Extract, Transform, Load, and Data Quality
- Configuration management with dataclasses
- Comprehensive logging system

📊 Multiple Data Sources
- CSV file extraction (with sample data generation)
- REST API extraction (with retry logic and error handling)
- Database extraction capabilities

🔧 Data Transformation
- Data cleaning and validation
- Type conversions and derived field calculations
- Data aggregation and summarization
- Audit field additions (timestamps, hashes)

✅ Data Quality Checks
- Null value validation
- Duplicate detection
- Data type verification
- Comprehensive quality reporting

💾 Robust Loading
- SQLite database setup and management
- Batch loading with error handling
- Load statistics and monitoring

🚨 Error Handling & Monitoring
- Retry logic for API calls
- Comprehensive logging
- Pipeline statistics tracking
- Graceful error recovery

## To run this pipeline:
1 - Install dependencies:
pip install pandas requests sqlite3 # bash

2 - Run the pipeline:
python etl_pipeline.py # bash

The pipeline will:
- Create sample sales data if CSV doesn't exist
- Extract user data from a public API
- Transform and clean all data
- Load everything into a SQLite database
- Provide execution statistics and sample results

## Production Enhancements:
For production use, you could extend this with:

- Airflow DAGs for scheduling
- Docker containers for deployment
- Cloud storage integration (S3, GCS)
- Data warehouse connections (Snowflake, BigQuery)
- Secrets management for credentials
- Monitoring dashboards with metrics

Would you like me to:

- Add specific transformations for your use case?
- Show how to integrate with cloud services?
- Create an Airflow DAG wrapper for this pipeline?
- Add more advanced data quality checks?
- Retry Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. Sonnet 4
